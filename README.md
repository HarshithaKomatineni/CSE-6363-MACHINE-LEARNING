# CSE-6363-MACHINE-LEARNING

This repository contains projects i have done under prof Dajiang Zhu in Fall 2022.

PROJ 1 :
1.Training a model via linear regression;
2. Using the trained model to do the classification;
3. Using cross-validation.

PROJ 2:
Naive Bayes classifiers are among the most successful known algorithms for learning to classify text documents. We will provide a dataset containing 20,000 newsgroup messages drawn from the 20 newsgroups. The dataset contains 1000 documents from each of the 20 newsgroups.
1. Please download the data from http://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/theo-11/www/naive-bayes.html (Newsgroup Data)
2. Please use half data as training data, and the other half as testing data.
3. Please implement the Naive Bayes classifier by yourself. Don't use any online code.

PROJ 3:
Do clustering using data and Fulfill the K - means clustering algorithm.
